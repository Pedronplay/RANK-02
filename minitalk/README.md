# MINITALK

The minitalk project is a critical exercise at 42, challenging students to implement their version of a client-server communication system using signals in C. This project is particularly useful for understanding signal handling and bitwise operations.

## About

The minitalk project at 42 offers an essential lesson in signal handling and bitwise operations in C. Implementing the client-server communication system enables students to grasp the intricacies of interprocess communication using signals.

The project also delves into the utilization of signal handlers and bitwise operators, enhancing students' understanding of low-level programming concepts and ensuring reliable communication between processes. Through hands-on implementation and thorough testing, students gain invaluable insights into the complexities of signal-based communication in C programming.
